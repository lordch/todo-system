# GTD: Clarify, Process & Organize

## Daily Inbox Processing

Process inbox items **one at a time, top to bottom**. Never skip items.

## The Processing Decision Tree

### Step 1: What is it?
Write a clear description if unclear.

### Step 2: Is it actionable?

#### ❌ NOT ACTIONABLE

- **Trash** → Delete it
- **Reference** → Move to appropriate reference location
- **Someday/Maybe** → Move to `someday-maybe.md`

#### ✅ ACTIONABLE

Go to Step 3 →

### Step 3: What's the next action?

Define the very next **physical, visible action** required.

#### A. Less than 2 minutes?
**→ Do it now** (then delete from inbox)

#### B. Can someone else do it?
**→ Delegate**
- Add to `waiting-for.md` with: `- [ ] [Person] - [Task] - [Date delegated]`

#### C. Takes longer / you must do it
**→ Defer** - Go to Step 4 →

### Step 4: Is it part of a project?

**Project = anything requiring more than one action**

#### Single Action
Move to appropriate list in `lists/`:
- Use context: `@home.md`, `@computer.md`, `@errands.md`, `@calls.md`, etc.
- Format: `- [ ] [Action verb] [specific outcome]`

#### Multiple Actions (Project)
1. Create project file in `projects/[project-name].md`
2. Add project to `index.md`
3. Identify **next action** and add to appropriate context list
4. Project file should contain:
   - Desired outcome
   - Brainstormed actions
   - Notes

## Organizing Guidelines

### Context Lists (`lists/`)
Group by **where/how** you can do them:
- `@home.md` - Physical location
- `@computer.md` - Tool required
- `@errands.md` - Out and about
- `@calls.md` - Phone needed
- `@agenda-[person].md` - To discuss with specific person

### Projects (`projects/`)
- One file per multi-step outcome
- Must have at least one next action on a context list
- Review weekly

### Calendar (Daily Plans)
**Only for:**
- Time-specific appointments
- Day-specific deadlines
- Day-specific information

**Not for:** General tasks (those go on lists)

## Processing Rules

1. **Never put items back in inbox** - decide now
2. **Process completely** - don't stop halfway
3. **Empty inbox daily** - goal is zero
4. **Next action must be physical** - "plan meeting" becomes "email John to suggest times"
5. **Projects need next actions** - always define what to do next
